    <div>
      <h2>Software Engineer Intern, Arista Networks</h2>
      <p>Developed and shipped feature to efficiently store and query IPv6
      addresses in radix tree map.</p>
      <p>Built anomaly and outlier detection algorithms for round-trip time
      of packets sent over the network, using Elasticsearch and Kibana.</p>
    </div>
    </br>

    <div>
      <h2>Software Engineer Intern, 98point6</h2>
      <p>Developed automated operations dashboard for Platform Engineering
      team using AWS CDK.</p>
      <p>Integrated metrics from Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring and AWS
      CloudWatch, Support, and Health services.</p>
      <p>Developed Tableau Web Data Connectors using AWS SDK, REST APIs to
      automatically pull metrics data.</p>
    </div>
    </br>


    <div>
      <h2>Research Assistant, Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory, University of Washington-Seattle</h2>
      <p>Developed non-contact acoustic sensing algorithm to detect and identify a user's exercise through their smartphone with 83.0% accuracy.</p>
      <p>Implemented ultrasound sensing through phone's speaker and microphone, used Fourier analysis to develop audio spectrograms
        for each exericse, and trained deep neural networks to analyze the spectrogram images and identify the performed exercise. </p>
      <p>Worked with graduate and undergraduate student researchers; advised by Dr. Shwetak Patel. </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="projects-h1">Projects</h1>
    </br>
    <div>
      <h2>DawgMaps</h2>
      <p>Developed Android application and React web app to crowdsource anonymous user location data.</p>
      <p>App displays real-time heatmap visualization of crowd density, overlayed on a Google Maps interface.</p>
      <p>In the COVID-19 era, users will benefit from having real-time information on which locations are
        safe to visit.</p>
      <p>Built during UW Hack'20 hackathon in a team of four members; finished top 3 out of 81 projects.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Libra</h2>
      <p>Contributed to open-source automatic machine learning (autoML) library that automates machine learning
        preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.</p>
      <p>Personal contributions: Developed backend for image classification (convolutional neural networks) and
        artificial image generation (generative adversarial networks) queries. </p>
      <p>Library has over 17,000 downloads. View source code <a href="https:www.github.com/palashio/libra">here</a></p>

    <div>
      <h2>PneumoNet</h2>
      <p>Developed deep learning classification algorithm to take a chest X-ray image as input and output
        a diagnosis for four heart and lung conditions (pneumonia, pneumothorax, cardiomegaly, pulmonary
        edema) </p>
      <p>Developed image classification algorithm using dataset of chest X-rays released by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
      <p>The algorithm's performance was comparable to performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on this dataset.</p>
