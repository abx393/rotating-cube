    <div>
      <h2>Research Assistant, Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory, University of Washington-Seattle</h2>
      <p>Developed non-contact acoustic sensing algorithm to detect and identify a user's exercise through their smartphone with 83.0% accuracy;
      preparing to submit for publication.</p>
      <p>Implemented ultrasound sensing through phone's speaker and microphone, used Fourier analysis to develop audio spectrograms
        for each exericse, and trained deep neural networks to analyze the spectrogram images and identify the performed exercise. </p>
      <p>Worked with graduate and undergraduate student researchers; advised by Dr. Shwetak Patel. </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Instructor, Coding with Kids</h2>
      <p>Taught weekly after-school classes to elementary school students in Scratch and Python programming languages.</p>
      <p>Worked with another instructor to teach provided curriculum and adapt lessons as necessary.</p>

      <h2>Libra</h2>
      <p>Contributed to open-source automatic machine learning (autoML) library that automates machine learning
        preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.</p>
      <p>Personal contributions: Developed backend for image classification (convolutional neural networks) and
        artificial image generation (generative adversarial networks) queries. </p>
      <p>Library has over 10,000 downloads.</p>
